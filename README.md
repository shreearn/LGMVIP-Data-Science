# Decision Tree Classifier for Iris Dataset

Task Description:

Implementing a Decision Tree Classifier on the Iris dataset to classify iris plant species based on sepal and petal measurements.


Dataset:

The Iris dataset contains the following columns:

- SepalLengthCm
- SepalWidthCm
- PetalLengthCm
- PetalWidthCm
- Species


Steps:

1. Importing necessary libraries.
2. Loading the dataset and preparing it for training.
3. Visualizing the dataset using scatter plots.
4. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Building the Decision Tree Classifier using the Gini criterion.
6. Visualizing the decision tree structure using tree.plot_tree and graphviz.
7. Evaluating the model's accuracy and generating a confusion matrix.
8. Predicting the iris species for custom data.


Required Libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- graphviz
